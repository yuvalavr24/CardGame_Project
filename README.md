# War Card Game üÉè
Welcome to the War Card Game repository! This Python program allows you to play the classic card game of War, where players compete to win all the cards in the deck.

## Overview
War (also known as Battle in the United Kingdom) is a simple card game typically played by two players using a standard playing card deck. The objective of the game is to win all of the cards. In this implementation, the player with the higher number of cards at the end of 10 rounds is declared the winner.

## How to Play
To play the game, follow these steps:

- Run the main Python program main.py.
- Enter the names of the two players.
- View the cards dealt to each player.
- Watch as the game progresses through 10 rounds.
- At the end of the game, the winner will be declared.

## Features
Object-oriented design: The game is implemented using classes and objects, making it modular and easy to understand.
Customizable: Players can enter their names and initial number of cards.
Interactive: The game prints out the moves and waits between rounds to build tension.
Unit tests: The program includes unit tests to ensure the correctness of the classes.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
No additional libraries or dependencies required

## How to Run
To run the game, simply download or clone the entire project directory onto your local machine. Then, navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt and execute the main.py file using Python:

python3 main.py

The program will automatically import the necessary classes (Card, CardGame, DeckOfCards, and Player) from the same directory as main.py. You don't need to separately save or import the individual class files.

Unit Tests
To run the unit tests for each class, follow these steps:

Download or clone the project directory onto your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
Execute the respective test files for each class using Python:

To run unit tests for the Card class:

- python3 Test_Card.py

To run unit tests for the CardGame class:

- python3 Test_CardGame.py

To run unit tests for the DeckOfCards class:

- python3 Test_DeckOfCards.py

To run unit tests for the Player class:

- python3 Test_Player.py
