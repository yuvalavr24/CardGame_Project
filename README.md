Welcome to the War Card Game repository! This Python program allows you to play the classic card game of War, where players compete to win all the cards in the deck.

## Overview
War (also known as Battle in the United Kingdom) is a simple card game typically played by two players using a standard playing card deck. The objective of the game is to win all of the cards. In this implementation, the player with the higher number of cards at the end of 10 rounds is declared the winner.
